I have decided to use `create react app`, since it is a fastest way of starting development with react. I didn't use any data management tools, since the app is small and I decided to go with just a react state.

Things I would improve:
_ Testing coverage. I wrote only one test for checking the default locale.
_ Implement loading state with smooth animation
\_ Store selected langauge locale in local storage or implement a router parameter.

The steps how to run the app locally you can find below.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
